HOW TO CREATE A SIMULATION PAGE:

* Test user downloads their personal source code and send it to researcher​

* Researcher uses the MHTML converter to produce the simulated webpage​
     * [Mht2htm.exe​](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mht2htm/)

* Link our JavaScript at the top of HTML​
     * `<script src="main.js"></script>`​

* Start the simulation with the test user​

* Researcher can export desired data from within browser console​ once the simulation test has concluded
     * mouseEventData() - Exports CSV of Click and Hover Data​
     * mousePositionData() - Exports CSV of mouse position from the start of the simulation​

* View data in spreadsheet viewer such as Excel for analysis​
